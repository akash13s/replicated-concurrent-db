class TransactionManager:
    """
    The TransactionManager class coordinates transactions across multiple sites. 
    It tracks active transactions, manages conflicts, and interacts with DataBroker and 
    SiteBroker to handle data access and transaction control.

    Attributes:
        data_broker (DataBroker): Manages the sites at which every data_id is replicated
        site_broker (SiteBroker): Maintains the status of each site_id
        transaction_map (Dict[int, Transaction]): A dictionary mapping transaction IDs to 
            Transaction objects.
        conflict_graph (Dict[int, List[int]]): Maintains an adjacency list representing transaction conflicts.
        site_managers (Dict[int, SiteManager]): A dictionary mapping site IDs to SiteManager instances.

    Methods:
        __init__(): Initializes the TransactionManager class.
        begin(t_id: int): Initiates a new transaction with the specified transaction ID.
        read(t_id: int, data_id: int): Processes a read request for a specific transaction and data item.
        write(t_id: int, data_id: int, value: int): Processes a write request for a specific transaction 
            and data item with the given value.
        dump(): Outputs the current state of all data managed by the system.
        end(t_id: int): Ends a specified transaction, committing or aborting based on conditions.
        fail(site_id: int): Handles failure events for a specific site.
        recover(site_id: int): Recovers a specified site from a failure state.
        queryState(): Provides the current state of the transactions and sites for debugging purpose.
