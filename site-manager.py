class SiteManager:
    """
    The SiteManager class manages data at an individual site. It oversees data access, 
    failure recovery, and logging operations. Each SiteManager instance is linked to a Site 
    object and maintains a history of data values, ensuring local data consistency.

    Attributes:
        site (Site): A reference to the Site object that the SiteManager manages.
        data_history (Dict[int, DataLog]): A dictionary that maintains a log of changes 
            for each data item managed by the site.

    Methods:
        __init__(): Initializes the SiteManager, setting up the site and data history.
        read(t_id: int, data_id: int): Reads the value of a specified data item for a transaction.
        write(t_id: int, data_id: int, value: int): Writes a new value to a specified data item 
            for a transaction.
        persist(t_id: int): Save the values written by a committed Transaction to the site.
        dump(): Outputs the current state of data items at the site.
        fail(site_id: int): Simulates a failure for the site, affecting data availability.
        recover(site_id: int): Recovers the site from a failure state.
        query_state(): Provides the current state and status of the site.
